## Insite Personal Data Tracking Tool

#### "I want to track and visualize sensitive information about my life without a corporation looking at it, selling it, or leaking it."

Insite is currently being developed for personal use. I may polish and release this for public use eventually but you are welcome to download and try it in the meantime.

## Goals:
- Robust local operation for assured privacy from data monetization
- Visualization for collected data
- Data tracking via survey
    - Activity Level
    - Spending
    - Mood & Mental Health
    - Others
- Survey builder
- csv, excel output
- Ingestion of other data sources
