## Insite Personal Data Tracking Tool

#### "I want to track and visualize sensitive information about my life with as little threat surface as possible
This means
- Private first
- Private network to reduce threat of data breaches or attacks
- No unencrpyted cloud backups to prevent data being sold or crawled


Insite is currently being developed for personal use. I may polish and release this for public use eventually but you are welcome to download and try it in the meantime.

## Goals:
- Robust local operation for assured privacy from data monetization
- Visualization for collected data
- Data tracking via survey
    - Activity Level
    - Spending
    - Mood & Mental Health
    - Others
- Survey builder
- csv, excel output
- Ingestion of other data sources
